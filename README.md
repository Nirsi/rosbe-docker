# rosbe-docker
Dockerized RosBE (ReactOS Build Environment)
I created this project because I wanted to test the latest news in ReactOS, but I didn't want to set up an environment every time.
Or if I want to set up rosbe on a remote server quickly, docker is the way.

#### start-rosbe.sh
Start script for quickly running rosbe without any additional configuration.
